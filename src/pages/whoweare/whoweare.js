                From the elegant rhythm of its making to the enchanting duet of
                sharing it with loved ones. The essence of chocolate is a living
                verse in every bite... Immersed in a world of art and music, our
                chocolates are a reflection of our inspiration.

                Crafted with traditional European techniques and equipment, they
                embody the essence of our creative journey... From the first
                cacao tree... Since the Aztecs used it as currency... From
                'xocolatl' to improvised Aztec's brew... To the recent
                'chocolates' of England and the Dutch mixes... To the first
                solid chocolate mixing of cocoa powder with cocoa butter and
                sugar and milk in 1847...
